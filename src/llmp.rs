A PoC for low level message passing

To send new messages, the clients place a new message at the end of their
client_out_map. If the ringbuf is filled up, they start place a
LLMP_AGE_END_OF_PAGE_V1 msg and alloc a new shmap.
Once the broker mapped a page, it flags it save for unmapping.

[client0]        [client1]    ...    [clientN]
  |                  |                 /
[client0_out] [client1_out] ... [clientN_out]
  |                 /                /
  |________________/                /
  |________________________________/
 \|/
[broker]

After the broker received a new message for clientN, (clientN_out->current_id
!= last_message->message_id) the broker will copy the message content to its
own, centralized page.

The clients periodically check (current_broadcast_map->current_id !=
last_message->message_id) for new incoming messages. If the page is filled up,
the broker instead creates a new page and places a LLMP_TAG_END_OF_PAGE_V1
message in its queue. The LLMP_TAG_END_PAGE_V1 buf contains the new string to
access the shared map. The clients then switch over to read from that new
current map.

[broker]
  |
[current_broadcast_map]
  |
  |___________________________________
  |_________________                  \
  |                 \                  \
  |                  |                  |
 \|/                \|/                \|/
[client0]        [client1]    ...    [clientN]

In the future, if we need zero copy, the current_broadcast_map could instead
list the client_out_map ID an offset for each message. In that case, the clients
also need to create new shmaps once their bufs are filled up.


To use, you will have to create a broker using llmp_broker_new().
Then register some clientloops using llmp_broker_register_threaded_clientloop
(or launch them as seperate processes) and call llmp_broker_run();
